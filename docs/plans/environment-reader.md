# Environment Reader — Harness Config Snapshots

Status: **design in progress**
Jira: AL-71

## Problem

tuneloop derives per-session facts (cost, files, PRs, complexity) but has no visibility into
the **harness configuration** that shaped those sessions. A developer who adds an MCP server,
installs custom agents, changes permission rules, or enables a plugin — tuneloop can't see it.
Config changes are the core adoption signal: did a config-snippet fix from a detector actually
get applied? Did adding a new agent correlate with cost/time improvement?

The environment reader captures a **versioned timeline of harness configuration**, so config
changes are visible and diffable, and the insight lifecycle can confirm a fix was adopted.

## Design principle: minimal surface area

We capture **only fields we know are useful today** and drop everything else. Two reasons:

1. **LLM safety.** Snapshots are read during processing and detector runs, some of which send
  data to an LLM (see Adoption detection — a config-diff check sends a snapshot slice to a
   model). The less we store, the less can ever leak. We never store **secrets** — env var
   values, MCP args/env/headers, hook command strings. We *do* store user-authored instruction
   bodies (agent system prompts, skill/command bodies, CLAUDE.md), because the body is the
   substance and adoption detection needs it; the tradeoff is accepted for these non-secret
   content fields. Because secrets are stripped at capture, the surviving snapshot is safe to
   send to a model.
2. **Signal over noise.** Preference fields (theme, editor mode) and auth plumbing carry no
  improvement-cycle signal. Start tight; add fields as concrete detectors need them.

The rule is an **allowlist**: a field is stored only if it appears in the tables below. Anything
else — including new keys a future harness version adds — is dropped by default.

## Goals

1. Snapshot harness config on every `analyze` run — starting with Claude Code.
2. Capture a **dated timeline** of config states (append-on-change, not per-run duplicates) so
  both "what is the config now" and "what was it at time T" are answerable.

## Categories are a harness-neutral vocabulary

The five categories below are the **abstract storage/UI vocabulary**, not CC-specific fields.
A harness populates only the categories it has; the `category` column is just a string, so an
absent category simply produces no rows.


| Category       | Universal?             | Notes                                                                                                                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `settings`     | Concept yes, format no | CC=JSON, Codex=TOML, OpenCode=JSON. Keys differ entirely per harness.                                                          |
| `mcp`          | **Yes**                | All supported harnesses (CC, Codex, OpenCode, Pi) have MCP.                                                                    |
| `agents`       | Mostly                 | Sub-agent *definitions*. Pi has no sub-agents → no rows.                                                                       |
| `skills`       | Ragged                 | CC = `SKILL.md` dirs, Codex = shell `SKILL.md` bundles, OpenCode = a `skill` tool, Pi = none. Same label, different mechanism. |
| `instructions` | **Yes**                | The project-instructions file: `CLAUDE.md` (CC) / `AGENTS.md` (Codex, OpenCode).                                               |


The **reader is fully per-harness** — there is no shared parsing (JSON vs TOML, `mcp__<server>`
vs `<server>_<tool>` namespacing, SKILL.md vs tool-based skills). Only the storage layer and
category vocabulary are shared.

## What we capture — by category (Claude Code)

Where `$CLAUDE_HOME` = `process.env.CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR ?? ~/.claude`.

### 1. `settings`

**Sources by scope:**


| Scope            | Path                                                              | Shared?         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| User (global)    | `$CLAUDE_HOME/settings.json`                                      | No              |
| Project (shared) | `settings.json` in every `.claude/` under the repo               | Yes (committed) |
| Project (local)  | `settings.local.json` in every `.claude/` under the repo         | No (gitignored) |

Project scope reads these in **every `.claude/` directory** under the repo (root + nested
monorepo packages — see Nested `.claude/` directories), keyed by repo-relative path.


**Fields captured** (nothing else):


| Field               | Capture               | Signal                                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `permissions.allow` | Yes (rule patterns)   | Permission posture — core adoption signal                |
| `permissions.deny`  | Yes                   | Security posture                                         |
| `permissions.ask`   | Yes                   | Always-confirm posture (rounds out the permission lists) |
| `enabledPlugins`    | Yes (names + boolean) | Ecosystem adoption                                       |


**Deliberately dropped:**


| Field                                                     | Why dropped                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `env`                                                     | Values are secrets                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `apiKeyHelper` / `awsCredentialExport` / `gcpAuthRefresh` | Auth plumbing, no signal                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `theme` / `editorMode`                                    | Preferences, no signal                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `permissionMode`                                          | Only the session *default*; actual mode is per-session and changes at runtime (shift-tab). Misleading as config; belongs in the adapter if we ever need per-session mode.                                |
| `model`                                                   | Only the configured default; actual per-message model is already in `usage_facts`, and `/model` changes it mid-session. Redundant + misleading as config.                                                |
| `hooks`                                                   | Config hooks add little on their own; runtime hook execution (`hookEvent`/`hookCount`/`hookErrors`) is already in the transcript and is the better source. Revisit later if adoption detection needs it. |


**Stored shape** (keyed per settings file by repo-relative path; a file whose whole content
is dropped by the allowlist is omitted):

```json
{
  ".claude/settings.json": {
    "permissions": { "allow": ["Bash(npm test *)"], "deny": [], "ask": [] },
    "plugins": { "frontend-design@claude-plugins-official": true }
  }
}
```

### 2. `mcp`

**Sources by scope:**


| Scope                     | Path                                                      | Shared?         |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| User (global)             | `$CLAUDE_HOME/.claude.json` → top-level `mcpServers`      | No              |
| Per-project (local state) | `$CLAUDE_HOME/.claude.json` → `projects.<cwd>.mcpServers` | No              |
| Project (shared)          | `<repo>/.mcp.json`                                        | Yes (committed) |


**Fields captured** (only these three — nothing that carries secrets):


| Field                   | Capture | Signal                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Server name             | Yes     | What capability is wired up — the core signal |
| `type` (http/sse/stdio) | Yes     | Local (stdio) vs remote (http/sse)            |
| `url`                   | Yes     | Endpoint identity (for http/sse servers) — stored credential-stripped: protocol + host + path only; userinfo, query, and fragment are dropped, and an unparseable URL is not stored |


Dropped: `command` (for a stdio server the user-chosen `name` already identifies it; `command`
alone is just `npx`/`uvx`), `args`, `env`, `headers`, `headersHelper`, `oauth`, `timeout`,
`alwaysLoad`. Everything dropped is either secret-bearing or a tuning knob with no signal.

**Stored shape** (keyed by source file, like `settings`; `.claude.json` at global scope is the
top-level `mcpServers`, at project scope the repo-root union of `projects.*` entries):

```json
{
  ".mcp.json": {
    "servers": { "atlassian": { "type": "sse", "url": "https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse" } }
  },
  ".claude.json": {
    "servers": { "postgres": { "type": "stdio" } }
  }
}
```

### 3. `agents`

**Sources by scope:**


| Scope         | Path                                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User (global) | `$CLAUDE_HOME/agents/*.md`                                    |
| Project       | `agents/*.md` in every `.claude/` under the repo             |

Project scope scans the `agents/` dir in every `.claude/` under the repo; each entry carries a
repo-relative `dir` so same-named agents in different packages coexist (see Nested `.claude/`
directories). Plugin-contributed agents also join this list, tagged `source` (see
Plugin-provided skills & agents).

**Fields captured:**


| Field                                   | Capture                | Signal                                                       |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Count                                   | Yes                    | How many custom agents                                       |
| Frontmatter `name`                      | Yes (else filename)    | Agent catalog                                                |
| Frontmatter `description`               | If present             | Purpose                                                      |
| Frontmatter `model`                     | If present             | Per-agent model preference (often `inherit` / omitted)       |
| Frontmatter `tools` / `disallowedTools` | If present             | Tool scoping (omitted = all tools)                           |
| Body (system prompt)                    | Yes — full text + hash | Instruction content — enables true adoption detection + diff |


The **agent body is the substance** (the system prompt IS the agent), so we store it in full,
not just a hash. This lets a detector confirm instruction-level adoption ("did the user add the
agent we suggested, with our instructions?") and diff an agent's definition across snapshots.
`bodyHash` is kept alongside as a cheap change-detection / versioning key. UI-only fields
(`color`) are dropped.

**Stored shape** (`dir` on project entries, `source` on plugin entries; neither on global):

```json
{
  "agents": [
    {
      "name": "code-reviewer",
      "description": "Review PRs for correctness",
      "model": "sonnet",
      "tools": ["Read", "Bash"],
      "body": "You are a code review specialist. For each changed file...",
      "bodyHash": "a1b2c3...",
      "dir": ".claude/agents"
    }
  ],
  "count": 1
}
```

### 4. `skills`

Custom commands have been **merged into skills** — `.claude/commands/deploy.md` and
`.claude/skills/deploy/SKILL.md` both create `/deploy` and behave the same. We capture both
formats into **one merged list**; the skills-vs-legacy-command distinction is a dying
implementation detail with no signal.

**Sources by scope:**


| Scope         | Path                                                            |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User (global) | `$CLAUDE_HOME/skills/*/SKILL.md` + `$CLAUDE_HOME/commands/*.md` |
| Project       | `skills/*/SKILL.md` + `commands/*.md` in every `.claude/` under the repo |

Project scope scans every `.claude/` under the repo; each entry carries a repo-relative `dir`
(see Nested `.claude/` directories). Plugin-contributed skills also join this list, tagged
`source` (see Plugin-provided skills & agents). A skill's name is the **directory name** for a
`SKILL.md` (invokable identity, not the frontmatter `name`) and the **filename** for a command.

**Fields captured** (mirrors agents — body is the substance):


| Field                     | Capture                | Signal                                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Count                     | Yes                    | Customization depth                                                                |
| Name                      | Yes                    | Skill catalog (SKILL.md → directory name; command → filename)                      |
| Frontmatter `description` | If present             | Purpose — always parse it; absent is fine (legacy commands often omit frontmatter) |
| Body                      | Yes — full text + hash | Instruction content — adoption detection + diff                                    |


Only `SKILL.md` files exactly one level deep (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) are skills; a `SKILL.md`
nested deeper (a skill's own supporting files) is not. Other frontmatter fields
(`disable-model-invocation`, `user-invocable`, `allowed-tools`, `disallowed-tools`) are dropped
for now — add them if a detector needs the invocation posture.

**Stored shape** (`dir` on project entries, `source` on plugin entries):

```json
{
  "skills": [
    { "name": "deploy", "description": "Deploy to staging", "body": "Run the deploy script...", "bodyHash": "d4e5f6...", "dir": ".claude/skills" },
    { "name": "review", "body": "Review the current diff...", "bodyHash": "...", "dir": ".claude/commands" }
  ],
  "count": 2
}
```

(`description` is omitted from an entry when the file has none — e.g. a bare legacy command.)

### 5. `instructions`

The project-instructions file — CC's `CLAUDE.md`. Plain markdown, no frontmatter, always-on. It
is the single richest adoption target (detector nudges like "add a rule about X" land here), so
we store the full body, mirroring agents/skills. `@import` references are stored **as-is,
unexpanded** for v1 (the import lines are visible in the raw text); resolving imports is deferred.

**Sources by scope:**


| Scope   | Path                                                        |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| User    | `$CLAUDE_HOME/CLAUDE.md`                                    |
| Project | every `CLAUDE.md` / `CLAUDE.local.md` under the repo        |

Project scope finds every `CLAUDE.md` / `CLAUDE.local.md` in the repo by filename — at the root,
in nested packages (`packages/x/CLAUDE.md`), and inside any `.claude/` (`<dir>/.claude/CLAUDE.md`).
Unlike settings, these can sit directly in a directory with no `.claude/`, so they're found by a
filename walk (see Nested `.claude/` directories).


**Fields captured** (per file, keyed by relative path like settings/mcp):


| Field | Capture                | Signal                                          |
| ----- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Body  | Yes — full text + hash | Instruction content — adoption detection + diff |


Absent and empty (whitespace-only) files are omitted — presence of a path key means a
non-empty file exists, so no separate `exists` flag is needed. `@import` references are stored
as-is, unexpanded.

**Stored shape:**

```json
{
  "CLAUDE.md": { "body": "# CLAUDE.md\n\nThis file provides...", "hash": "j0k1l2..." },
  ".claude/CLAUDE.md": { "body": "...", "hash": "..." },
  "CLAUDE.local.md": { "body": "...", "hash": "..." }
}
```

Rules (`.claude/rules/*.md`) are **dropped for v1** — a rule without `paths` is just CLAUDE.md
by another name, and path-scoped rules add a `paths` signal we don't yet consume. Revisit when
a detector needs path-scoped instruction data.

---

## Scope summary

Each category has a **global** component (user-level, same across all repos) and a
**project** component (varies per repo). The snapshot distinguishes these:


Except `mcp`, project scope reads from **every `.claude/` under the repo** (root + nested
packages), not just the root.

| Category       | Global scope                              | Project scope                                                  |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `settings`     | `$CLAUDE_HOME/settings.json`              | `settings.json` + `settings.local.json` in each `.claude/`     |
| `mcp`          | `$CLAUDE_HOME/.claude.json` → per-project | `<repo>/.mcp.json` + `.claude.json` entries under the repo     |
| `agents`       | `$CLAUDE_HOME/agents/`                    | `agents/` in each `.claude/`                                   |
| `skills`       | `$CLAUDE_HOME/skills/` + `commands/`      | `skills/` + `commands/` in each `.claude/`                     |
| `instructions` | `$CLAUDE_HOME/CLAUDE.md`                  | every `CLAUDE.md` / `CLAUDE.local.md` under the repo           |

## Mechanism

### When: on every `analyze` run

Config is captured at analyze time, not via a hook. The reasoning: adoption detection needs a
**timeline of config states over calendar time** ("did the permission rule appear after we
suggested it?"), which analyze-time snapshots give directly. It doesn't need per-session
accuracy. Analyze-time capture is also zero-setup, works for every user and every past session
immediately, and avoids the install/maintenance burden of a hook. (See Deferred: SessionStart
hook for the one case that would justify a hook.)

### Two-phase read (global once + per unique project)

The reader piggybacks on paths analyze already resolves. Analyze parses each session's
`project.cwd` and resolves it to a repo root via git (cached per cwd). So the set of distinct
repo roots across all sessions *is* the project list — no separate discovery pass.

**Phase A — global (once per run):** read `$CLAUDE_HOME` config → write `scope='global'`,
`scope_key='_global'` snapshots for each category present.

**Phase B — per unique project (once per repo root, not per session):** for each distinct repo
root, read its config across every `.claude/` under the repo (settings/agents/skills), every
`CLAUDE.md`/`CLAUDE.local.md`, `.mcp.json`, and the `~/.claude.json` MCP entries under it → write
`scope='project'`, `scope_key=<repo root>` snapshots (one row per category; nested config lives
inside the payload).

Only repos with **sessions this run** are snapshotted — a configured-but-unused repo won't
appear. That's fine for adoption (adoption cares about repos with activity).

### Placement in the analyze pipeline

Runs after the session loop (repos all resolved) and **before detectors**, so a config-diff
detector in the same run sees the fresh snapshot:

```
discover → normalize → [per session: ingest + processors]
  → ★ capture environment (global once + per unique repo)   ← here
  → refresh artifacts → prune
  → run detectors            (config-diff detector reads fresh snapshots)
  → reconcile fix sightings  (existing marker path, feat/fix-delivery)
  → stamp last_analyze_at
```

It is a **standalone pipeline step**, not a processor — config is not session-derived, and a
per-session processor would re-read the same files N times.

### Deferred: SessionStart hook (per-session accuracy)

A hook that captures config at session-creation time (writing one file per session under
`~/.tuneloop/env-snapshots/<source>/<session-id>.json`) is the only way to get **true
point-in-time** config. It is deferred, not part of v1, because:

- Adoption (the primary use case) needs a config *timeline*, not per-session attribution.
- The analyze-time timeline + point-in-time lookup (below) is a good-enough approximation.
- A hook is real install/support surface (edits `settings.json`, must handle custom
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, breaks if CC changes hook format) and only works going forward.

**Named trigger to revisit:** when a P-tier (per-session LLM) detector needs accurate
point-in-time config and the analyze-cadence approximation proves too coarse (see the staleness
caveat under Reading). That is the concrete need the hook — and per-session capture — would
serve.

## Storage

### Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS environment_snapshots (
  source           TEXT NOT NULL,   -- 'claude-code' (which harness)
  scope            TEXT NOT NULL,   -- 'global' | 'project'
  scope_key        TEXT NOT NULL,   -- '_global' for global; repo root for project
  category         TEXT NOT NULL,   -- 'settings' | 'mcp' | 'agents' | 'skills' | 'instructions'
  content_hash     TEXT NOT NULL,   -- hash of snapshot_json (the change-detection key)
  snapshot_json    TEXT NOT NULL,   -- the redacted captured payload for this category
  captured_at      TEXT NOT NULL,   -- when this state FIRST appeared (change timeline)
  last_observed_at TEXT NOT NULL,   -- most recent analyze run that confirmed this state
  PRIMARY KEY (source, scope, scope_key, category, content_hash)
);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS ix_env_snapshots_lookup
  ON environment_snapshots(source, scope, scope_key, category, captured_at);
```

### Two timestamps (the timeline nuance)

- `captured_at` — when this config state *first appeared*. Across rows, these form the dated
change timeline. A state is understood to persist from its `captured_at` until the next row's
`captured_at` — so we get a full timeline without storing per-run duplicates.
- `last_observed_at` — the last analyze run that saw this exact state, updated in place on a
no-change run. Distinguishes "confirmed still X" from "assumed X, didn't look" (config could
have round-tripped between two runs we never observed).

### Write logic (append-on-change, no duplicates)

For each `(scope, scope_key, category)` read this run:

```
h = hash(payload)
latest = latest row for (source, scope, scope_key, category)
if latest and latest.content_hash == h:
    UPDATE latest.last_observed_at = now       # confirm, no new row
else:
    INSERT new row (captured_at = last_observed_at = now)
```

**Deletions are tombstoned.** A category with stored history that a *successful* read no
longer returns was removed from disk; capture writes a `null`-payload snapshot through the
same gate, so current/asOf reflect the deletion ("remove X" fixes are confirmable adoptions
too). A *failed* read never tombstones — no evidence the config is gone, only that we
couldn't look.

### Reading

**Current state** (adoption "is the fix present now"):

```sql
SELECT snapshot_json FROM environment_snapshots
WHERE source=? AND scope=? AND scope_key=? AND category=?
ORDER BY captured_at DESC LIMIT 1
```

**Point-in-time** (`configAsOf` — a P-tier detector wanting config as it was for a session):

```sql
SELECT snapshot_json FROM environment_snapshots
WHERE source=? AND scope=? AND scope_key=? AND category=? AND captured_at <= ?   -- session.startedAt
ORDER BY captured_at DESC LIMIT 1
```

Per-session detectors MUST read via `configAsOf`, never "latest" — else an old session gets
today's config and a detector can wrongly suppress a real insight. If the query returns nothing
(no reading before the session — common on first analyze), the caller flags the result
**stale** so a detector can down-weight or abstain rather than assert. True point-in-time
requires the deferred hook.

### Retention

v1 **keeps everything** — volume is change-gated (single-digit rows per category per year;
config changes are rare) so there is no space pressure, and premature pruning risks deleting the
*before* state a later-surfaced insight needs for its diff.

The latest row per `(scope, scope_key, category)` is kept indefinitely (current state). Orphan-
pruning of *superseded* historical rows — those with no live session in their active window and
no open insight referencing them — is a **fast-follow**, mirroring analyze's existing
`pruneOrphanArtifacts` step. Not v1.

### `scope_key` for project MCP

File config (`.claude/`, `.mcp.json`, `CLAUDE.md`) keys cleanly on **repo root**. But
`~/.claude.json` MCP is keyed by **exact cwd** — a repo can have different MCP servers per
subdirectory the user worked in. v1 simplification: key everything on **repo root**, and
**union** the MCP servers from every `~/.claude.json` entry under that repo into one repo-level
`mcp` snapshot. Lossy (drops per-subdirectory precision), but rare in practice — most users run
from the repo root or share one MCP config. Revisit if subdir-scoped MCP proves to matter.

---

## Nested `.claude/` directories (monorepo sub-packages)

CC reads config from **every `.claude/` directory** in a repo — the root and each monorepo
sub-package (`packages/frontend/.claude/…`), plus `CLAUDE.md` files that can sit directly in any
directory. The project-scope readers capture all of them. (`mcp` is exempt — it has no
nested-`.claude/` concept; its per-cwd config lives in `.claude.json` and is unioned per repo.)

### Multiple dirs live inside the per-repo payload

The several dirs are represented **inside the one per-repo snapshot**, not as extra rows — the
same "key by source path, don't merge, keep collisions visible" pattern `settings` and `mcp`
already use. `scope_key` stays the repo root, so there is still one snapshot row per
(repo, category); the append-on-change timeline and every consumer are unchanged, only the
payload is richer. A change in any package's config re-snapshots that one per-repo row.

- **settings / instructions** — keyed by each file's **repo-relative path**.
- **agents / skills** — a list, each entry carrying a repo-relative **`dir`**, so same-named
  entries in different packages coexist instead of colliding.

**Payload shape** (settings by path; agents by `dir`):
```json
{
  ".claude/settings.json":                   { "permissions": {…} },
  "packages/frontend/.claude/settings.json": { "permissions": {…} }
}
```
```json
{
  "agents": [
    { "name": "reviewer", "dir": ".claude/agents", "body": "…", "bodyHash": "…" },
    { "name": "reviewer", "dir": "packages/web/.claude/agents", "body": "…", "bodyHash": "…" }
  ],
  "count": 2
}
```

### Discovery

A single downward walk from the repo root finds every `.claude/` dir (shared across
settings/agents/skills) and every `CLAUDE.md` / `CLAUDE.local.md` (for instructions — these
can live in a directory with no `.claude/`, so they're found by filename). The walk skips
`node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, `build`, `vendor`, `venv`, `target`, and other dot-directories
(never the user's config), and runs once per repo, shared across the readers.

Skills stay **depth-1** within each `skills/` dir — a skill is `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; a
`SKILL.md` nested deeper (a skill's own `examples/`) is a supporting file, not a skill.

The snapshot records config **presence** (the config exists in the repo), matching the reader's
current-state model — not which sub-package a given session happened to work in.

---

## Plugin-provided skills & agents

An enabled plugin contributes its own skills and agents (e.g. `frontend-design` ships a
`frontend-design` skill). The `skills` and `agents` categories include these alongside the
user/project ones, each tagged `source: "plugin:<id>"` (parallel to the `dir` used for nested
project config) — complementing the plugin *names*, which `settings` already captures via
`enabledPlugins`.

**Resolution**, run per scope: compute EFFECTIVE enablement first — for the project snapshot,
`settings.local.json` overrides `settings.json` per plugin id (a local `false` is how CC
disables a project-enabled plugin for one user) — then map each enabled id through
`$CLAUDE_HOME/plugins/installed_plugins.json` to the install entry whose scope matches → its
`installPath` → read `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` for skill/agent dirs (`skills` adds to the
default `skills/`; `commands`/`agents` replace their defaults; a manifest path that escapes
the install root is dropped) → read those dirs and tag with the plugin id. `user` installs
feed the global snapshot; `project`/`local` installs feed the repo's.

---

## Security principles

We store a **small, fixed allowlist** of structural fields. This is the primary defense —
secrets are never read in the first place, so nothing can leak into an LLM prompt (including the
config-diff adoption check).

1. **Never store env var values** — `env` is dropped entirely (both settings and MCP).
2. **Never store MCP secrets** — only name, type, url. Command, args, env, headers,
  headersHelper, oauth, timeout, and alwaysLoad are dropped. URLs are stored
   credential-stripped (no userinfo, query, or fragment); an unparseable URL is dropped.
3. **Never store hook command strings** — hooks are dropped from settings entirely.
4. **Never touch** `credentials.json` or any auth token store.
5. **Instruction bodies are stored** (agent system prompts, skill/command bodies, CLAUDE.md).
  These are user-authored content, not secrets — the adoption signal needs them. They are the
   one place snapshot data is non-trivial in size; keep them out of any LLM prompt that doesn't
   specifically need them.
6. **Allowlist, not blocklist** — a field is captured only if it appears in the tables above.

# Part 3 — OpenCode reader

The storage layer, the harness-neutral category vocabulary, the two-phase capture (global once +
per unique repo root), append-on-change, and deletion tombstones are all **inherited unchanged**
from Parts 1–2. Adding OpenCode is therefore a single new reader:

- `src/adapters/opencode/environment.ts` exporting `readOpencodeEnvironment(projectPath?)` →
  `EnvCategorySnapshot[]`, plus
- one line in `src/adapters/opencode/index.ts` (`readEnvironment: readOpencodeEnvironment`).

No store, schema, or `analyze.ts` change is needed — `reposBySource` already resolves OpenCode
repo roots from `session.project.cwd`, so project-scope capture runs the moment the hook exists.

## Snapshots are independent per-harness views

Every `environment_snapshots` row is keyed by `source` (the adapter id) as the leading PK column.
The `claude-code` and `opencode` snapshots are **fully isolated** and are consumed independently —
each is read only to advise *that* harness. Nothing is summed across sources, so there is **no
double-counting** and therefore **no "skip" rule**: the OpenCode reader captures *every* location
OpenCode honors, including its Claude-compatible and agent-compatible fallback dirs
(`.claude/skills/`, `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `.agents/skills/`, …). The same physical file
appearing in both the `claude-code` and `opencode` snapshots is correct — they are two different
harnesses' effective config, and advice about OpenCode must read off OpenCode's effective config.

## Structural differences from Claude Code (why it isn't copy-paste)

1. **Config home ≠ data home.** The adapter's `defaultRoots` is the *data* dir
   (`~/.local/share/opencode`, which holds `opencode.db`). Config lives elsewhere, under
   `opencodeConfigHome()`:
   `$OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` → else `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode` → else `~/.config/opencode`.
   An explicit config *file* override is `$OPENCODE_CONFIG`. Global-scope reads must use the
   config home, never the data root.
2. **One JSONC file feeds four categories.** `opencode.json` **or** `opencode.jsonc` packs
   `permission` + `plugin` (settings), `mcp`, inline `agent` (agents), inline `command` (skills),
   and `instructions` refs. A single parse fans out; the `.md`/`SKILL.md` scans layer on top.
3. **JSONC parsing is new.** The repo has no JSONC support today. A small comment-/trailing-
   comma-tolerant parse helper is required (JSON alone will not parse the user's `.jsonc`).
   Variable substitution (`{env:…}`, `{file:…}`) is left literal — since secrets are dropped, a
   substituted MCP url simply fails `redactUrl` and is dropped (safe).
4. **Directory names vary; config keys are singular.** In the config file the keys are singular
   (`agent`, `command`, `plugin`). On disk the docs read as plural (`agents/`, `commands/`,
   `skills/`, `plugins/`), but OpenCode has used the singular dir names across versions — so the
   reader scans **both** `agents/`+`agent/` and `commands/`+`command/` (missing dirs yield `[]`,
   so scanning both is free and version-robust). `skills/` is confirmed plural.
5. **`permission` is an object, not allow/deny/ask arrays** (`{ edit, bash, webfetch }` → enum
   `ask|allow|deny`, or nested glob→enum). Different allowlist shape from CC.
6. **`AGENTS.md` is `instructions`, not `agents`.** OpenCode's `agents/*.md` are sub-agent
   definitions; `AGENTS.md` is the CLAUDE.md-equivalent.

## Shared-helper extraction

OpenCode's `SKILL.md` and frontmatter handling are identical to CC's. Rather than reimplement or
import cross-adapter, extract the reusable primitives into **`src/adapters/env-shared.ts`** and
have both readers import them: `splitFrontmatter`, `parseFrontmatter`, `toStringList`,
`readSkillFile`, the agent-frontmatter parse, `redactUrl`, `readJsonIfExists`, `isUnder`,
`listDirs`, `contentHash`-of-body. `claude-code/environment.ts` and `opencode/environment.ts`
then share one implementation.

## What we capture — by category (OpenCode)

Where `$OC_HOME` = `opencodeConfigHome()` and `<repo>` is a project root. Each category's payload
is **keyed by on-disk source** (file path / dir+name), so every location is distinguishable and
the `content_hash` moves when any one changes.

### 1. `settings`

**Sources:** `$OC_HOME/opencode.json[c]` (global); `<repo>/opencode.json[c]` (project). Keyed by
source file path.

| Field                 | Capture                | Signal                                             |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `permission`          | Yes (object as-is)     | Tool-approval posture — core adoption signal       |
| `plugin`              | Yes (npm names / specs)| Ecosystem adoption (parallel to CC `enabledPlugins`)|
| `model` / `small_model` / `default_agent` | Candidate (non-secret model posture) | Model-choice adoption — include if a detector needs it |

**Dropped:** **`provider`** (holds API keys — never read), `keybinds`/`theme`/`tui`, `formatter`/
`lsp`/`watcher`/`compaction`/`experimental`, and `mcp`/`agent`/`command` (their own categories).

### 2. `mcp`

**Sources:** the `mcp` object in the global and project `opencode.json[c]`. Keyed by source file →
server name.

| Field     | Capture                          | Notes                                             |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`    | Yes (`local` \| `remote`)        |                                                   |
| `url`     | remote only, credential-stripped | via `redactUrl`; `{env:…}` → unparseable → dropped |
| `enabled` | If present (bool)                |                                                   |

**Dropped (secret-bearing / signal-free):** `command`, `cwd`, **`environment`**, **`headers`**,
**`oauth`**, `timeout`.

### 3. `agents`

**Sources:** `agents/*.md` (`$OC_HOME/agents/`, `<repo>/.opencode/agents/`) **and** inline `agent`
objects in `opencode.json[c]` (global + project). File entries key `name` off the filename; inline
entries key off the config path + object key and tag `source: "config"`.

| Field                         | Capture                | Signal                        |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `name`                        | Yes (filename / key)   | Agent catalog                 |
| `description`                 | If present             | Purpose                       |
| `mode` (`primary`/`subagent`/`all`) | If present       | Agent role                    |
| `model`                       | If present             | Per-agent model preference    |
| Body (markdown body / inline `prompt`) | Yes — full + hash | System prompt — adoption + diff |

**Dropped:** `color`, `temperature`, `permission`, `steps`, `top_p`, `hidden`, `disable`, `tools`
(deprecated), provider passthrough. (Docs list no `.claude/agents` fallback for agents — native
locations only.)

### 4. `skills`

The harness-neutral `skills` category holds both OpenCode **skills** (`SKILL.md`) and **commands**
(the user-invoked `/slash` prompts) — mirroring how CC folds commands into skills — with each entry
tagged `kind: "skill" | "command"` so the two remain distinguishable.

**Skill sources — all six searched `<name>/SKILL.md` locations (merged), keyed by (location, name):**

| Scope   | Locations                                                              |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Project | `.opencode/skills/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`             |
| Global  | `$OC_HOME/skills/`, `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/`          |

`name` = directory name (must equal frontmatter `name`); capture `description` + body + hash;
`kind: "skill"`. `SKILL.md` shape is identical to CC → reuse `readSkillFile`.

**Command sources:** `commands/*.md` (`$OC_HOME/commands/`, `<repo>/.opencode/commands/`) **and**
inline `command` objects in the config. `name` = filename / key; capture `description`, `agent`,
`model` + body (`template`) + hash; `kind: "command"`.

**Dropped:** `subtask`; skill `license` / `compatibility` / `metadata` (low signal).

### 5. `instructions`

**Effective/active only** — apply OpenCode's fallback precedence and store *only* what OpenCode
actually loads (a shadowed file OpenCode ignores is not stored). Keyed by file path; empty files
omitted; bodies stored full + hash.

| Scope   | Active source (in precedence order)                                                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Global  | `$OC_HOME/AGENTS.md`; **else** fallback `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`                         |
| Project | `<repo>/AGENTS.md` (+ nested `AGENTS.md` under the repo); **else** fallback `<repo>/CLAUDE.md` |
| Both    | every file matched by the config `instructions[]` globs (always combined; local paths only — remote URLs deferred) |

## Scope summary (OpenCode)

| Category       | Global scope                                            | Project scope                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `settings`     | `$OC_HOME/opencode.json[c]`                             | `<repo>/opencode.json[c]`                                            |
| `mcp`          | `mcp{}` in `$OC_HOME/opencode.json[c]`                  | `mcp{}` in `<repo>/opencode.json[c]`                                 |
| `agents`       | `$OC_HOME/agents/*.md` + inline `agent{}`              | `<repo>/.opencode/agents/*.md` + inline `agent{}`                    |
| `skills`       | 3 global `skills/<n>/SKILL.md` + `commands/*.md` + inline `command{}` | 3 project `skills/<n>/SKILL.md` + `.opencode/commands/*.md` + inline |
| `instructions` | `$OC_HOME/AGENTS.md` (→ `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`) + `instructions[]` | `<repo>/AGENTS.md` (+ nested; → `<repo>/CLAUDE.md`) + `instructions[]` |

## Symlinks & deduplication (both readers)

Skills, agents, and commands are commonly **symlinked** to share them across harness dirs (e.g.
`~/.claude/skills/foo` → `~/.agents/skills/foo`). Two shared fixes make the readers handle this —
they apply to the Claude Code reader as well, not just OpenCode:

- **Follow symlinks.** `listDirs` and `walkFiles` (in `env-shared.ts` / `util/walk.ts`) previously
  filtered on `Dirent.isDirectory()`, which is **false for a symlink-to-a-directory** — so a
  symlinked skill dir was silently dropped even though the harness loads it. Both now resolve
  symlinks (with a visited-realpath guard in `walkFiles` so a symlink cycle terminates).
- **Dedupe by real path.** Because the same physical skill can be reached through several
  locations (a real dir plus symlinks into it), each reader keeps a `Set` of source-file
  realpaths and collapses entries that resolve to the same file — so a skill symlinked into
  `.claude` **and** `.agents` appears once, not twice. Scan order lists likely-real locations
  first, so the real location wins the surviving `dir` label. This mirrors the "effective, not
  raw on-disk" choice made for instructions.

## Out of scope (v1)

Remote config (`.well-known/opencode`), `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` inline overrides, managed
system configs (`/Library/Application Support/opencode`, `/etc/opencode`), local plugin JS bodies
in `plugins/` dirs (names captured via `settings.plugin`, not the code), remote-URL entries in
`instructions[]`, and `tui.json`.

## Security (delta from Part 2)

Same allowlist-not-blocklist principle. OpenCode-specific **never-store**: the `provider` block
(API keys), MCP `environment` / `headers` / `oauth`, any `{env:…}`-substituted value, and the data
dir's `auth.json` (never touched). Instruction/agent/skill/command bodies are stored (user-authored
content, not secrets — the adoption signal needs them), consistent with CC.
